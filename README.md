# Swipeable Tabs with recyclerView

This is a simple tutorial on using tablayout, fragments and recyclerview. You can use it as a template to create a tabs app.

There are three tabs. Each Tab is connected to a fragment which gets displayed when the user clicks the tab.

Users can also swipe through the fragments. The fragments contain recyclerviews with images and text. Useful to use for example in creating a movie app.
